# A small effector tutorial 

This project created with CRA. Yarn start will help you =)

Main libs:  
``1) effector - main lib``  
``2) effector/react - connecting to react``  
``3) patronum - usefull helper``


I decided to make this tutorial step by step. You can find small parts in project branches.
In last branch it will be a completed feature with conditions/data fetching/ splitting events.



### BRANCHES
1) **effector/events-store** - you can find how to start with easy stores and events in effector.
2) **effector/effects-api** - fetching and handlering data.
3) **effector/samples** - sending data/ split code.
4) **effector/process** - how can we handle process for page.
